 - Explain how data is presented and updated in real-time.
#### Visual Representation:
 - Detail the use of graphics, icons, and any visual elements on the battlefield grid.

#### Responsiveness:
 - Outline how the UI adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).

### 2.2 Back End
#### Server Architecture:
 - Specify the server architecture (e.g., client-server, microservices).
 - Detail the server-side technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask).

#### Database Design:
