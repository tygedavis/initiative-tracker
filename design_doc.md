# Dungeons & Dragons Initiative Tracker Design Document
## 1. Introduction
**Purpose**: 

The primary objective of this application is to furnish participants engaged in a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) campaign with a visual mechanism to discern the commencement of their turn within the gameplay. The overarching intent is to enhance the efficiency of turn-based interactions, particularly in scenarios involving multiple characters. Through the implementation of this feature, the application aims to expedite the pace of gameplay, thereby optimizing the overall gaming experience for participants.

**Scope**: 
1. **Turn-Based Facilitation**: The primary function of the application is to seamlessly guide players through the turn-based structure inherent in D&D gameplay.
This includes a visual representation to clearly demarcate when a player's turn commences.

2. **Multifaceted Character Management**: The application is tailored to accommodate scenarios involving multiple characters within a campaign.
It is engineered to address the intricacies of managing and expediting turns for each character efficiently.

3. **Enhanced Gameplay Efficiency**: A central objective is to significantly augment the speed and fluidity of turn-based play.
By mitigating potential delays associated with turn transitions, the application aims to optimize overall gameplay efficiency.

4. **Intuitive User Interface**: The scope involves the implementation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring accessibility for players of varying experience levels with D&D.

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Front End
#### User Interface (UI):
 - Describe the overall layout and design principles.
 - Detail components, such as header, turn display, player info, turn controls, etc.
 - Specify the technology stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and any front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular).

#### Interaction Design:
 - Describe user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, advancing turns).
 - Explain how data is presented and updated in real-time.
#### Visual Representation:
 - Detail the use of graphics, icons, and any visual elements on the battlefield grid.

#### Responsiveness:
 - Outline how the UI adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).

### 2.2 Back End
#### Server Architecture:
 - Specify the server architecture (e.g., client-server, microservices).
 - Detail the server-side technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask).

#### Database Design:
 - Define the database schema for storing player information, turn history, and other relevant data.
 - Discuss the choice of database system (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).

#### APIs and Communication:
